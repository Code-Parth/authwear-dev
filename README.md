- Merch collaborators release their merchandise on our platform and each product is assigned a UID and Qr code.
- During the purchase of the product, the generated UID(nft form) will be transferred to the customer’s address.
- Buyers and chain buyers can verify the authenticity of the product using the QR code that will be embedded on the product in a label or any feasible form.



1. **Blockchain Verification**: Each fashion item is associated with a unique NFT (Non-Fungible Token) on the XinFin blockchain, guaranteeing authenticity.

2. **QR Code Scanning**: Users can scan the QR code on fashion items to access official history linked to the product's owner, including authenticity checks and provenance.
